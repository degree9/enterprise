This library is provided as an extension to [degree9/meta](http://github.com/degree9/meta).  
Where [meta] only provides the basic application server/client, D9 Enterprise provides a collection of services which can be mounted to server endpoints, as well as helpful service hooks and client components.

## Testing

Tests currently run against phantomjs and all namespaces.

`$ boot watch test-cljs`
